## Will I make money tailing the Sharpshooter AI Agent's picks?

As we all know, there is no such thing as a lock and winning is never guaranteed. However, Sharpshooter only looks at plays and data from the Revolver Handicapper Index, which contains only cappers with long-term profit, and puts those picks through a further analysis as described above. Handicappers included in scope combined for over 500 units profit in 2024; tailing their picks with $100 betting units would have resulted in over $50,000 profit.

Therefore, although there will no doubt be wins and losses, big money-making win streaks and excruciating losing streaks, the Sharpshooter AI Agent is expected to produce reliable, long-term profit to Bettors Club members. 

## Does the Sharpshooter AI Agent use free or paid picks? 

Sharpshooter's scope includes handicappers that provide free picks and handicappers that provide paid picks. The only criterion is that they have a tracked record showing long-term, consistent profit. Sharpshooter is also consistently building its own knowledge base, and analyzing picks with a view to broader market trends.
